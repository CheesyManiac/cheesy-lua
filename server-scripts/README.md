# Usage

Free to use and modify as you want. Some credit somewhere would be nice.

You probably want to use a hosting service to hold the file. Github or [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) are fine.

# CSP Wiki

You'll need to follow the instructions on the [CSP Wiki](https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-extension-config/wiki/Misc-%E2%80%93-Server-extra-options#online-scripts)

Something like this is fine:

```ini
[SCRIPT_...]
SCRIPT = "https://pastebin.com/00000000000"
```
