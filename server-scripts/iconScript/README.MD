# Server Icon Script V1

Because I saw so many questions on how to do this, I decided to make a public version. V0.1 I threw together in about an hour, and some larger changes for v0.2.

### Noteworthy Features:
* Has multiple Image slots
* Has a timer to display a splashscreen before the driver moves (thing a Rules list)
* Places the icon in the top left

V1 is now depreciated and there is a very good chance it won't get updates.

# Server Icon Script v2

V0.3 brought such an enormous overhaul to the entire script, it's practically not the same script as before. This is now split off into v2.

### A few noteworthy features:
* Support for GIFs. Video would be possible however it would need to be a custom edit, feel free to DM on Discord if you want that.
* 9 positions around the screen which can be easily selected in the script without doing the maths.
* Support for multiple images and locations for each.
* Debug functions available for admins to debug the image locations (accessed when you have ADMIN perms, using the **Light Bulb** in the CSP chat app)

### To Do List:
* Triple monitor adaption
* Make it into an [AssettoServer](https://assettoserver.org) plugin with proper config support, so that the script can be handed off the server instead.
* Add proper video player support
* Customisation for the driver
* A nicer "Rules" page where the car is locked until the driver accepts the rules.
* Make it so the script can be edited in-game

### Current Issues:
* Sometimes on first load the icons aren't placed correctly or even load. Dunno why, still looking into it
